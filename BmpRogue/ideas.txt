What can STEGANOGRAPHY be used for?
...................................
There are a number of uses for steganography besides the
 mere novelty. One of the most widely used applications is
  for so-called digital watermarking. A watermark, historically,
   is the replication of an image, logo, or text on paper stock
    so that the source of the document can be at least partially
     authenticated. A digital watermark can accomplish the same
      function; a graphic artist, for example, might post sample
       images on her Web site complete with an embedded signature
        so that she can later prove her ownership in case others
         attempt to portray her work as their own.

Stego can also be used to allow communication within an underground community.
 There are several reports, for example, of persecuted religious minorities using
  steganography to embed messages for the group within images that are posted to known Web sites.
